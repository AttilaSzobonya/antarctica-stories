# The attack of 'De Groenvaart'[^license]
"Zou zou!" a ship worker shouted at Maarten, who was standing lost on a ship he had never set foot on before. "Move along!" the ship worker barked finally when he saw that it didn’t register with Maarten. Not wanting to show that he had no idea which way to go, Maarten started pacing along with other people carrying luggage. They made their way under the bridge, where the words "De Groenvaart" towered over their heads, painted in green.

Maarten hoped he hadn’t made a lasting impression on that ship worker. The Merchant's Dialect was hard. It felt more like garbled Chinese than English. Even though he had sat through all the lessons, English was not his native language. Not to mention, that many common words were swapped out for Chinese ones, muttered in a way that blurred into an endless stream of sounds, making commands almost unintelligible. He had even taken a test, but hearing it in real life was different. In the end though, he had to know enough to follow commands or risk being useless—and useless wasn’t an option for a ship worker.

They navigated through seemingly endless corridors, following signs that pointed them to sleeping quarter B. Suddenly, bunks appeared on either side, and Maarten started looking for his.

That was it: Bunk B17. His private sphere measured two meters by 1.2 meters. His name, 'Maarten Vos,' was scrawled on a sticky note in negligent handwriting beside the curtain.

To be honest, it wasn’t that small, and it had everything he needed: a bed with a blanket, compartments for belongings, some charging ports, lights, and a curtain to shut the world out—at least visually. He’d still be on a ship in the middle of the ocean, Antarctica-bound, no matter how much nature warned against it.

The smell, though, was harder to ignore. Sweat and oil clung to the air, mixing with something faintly sour, like the sheets hadn’t been washed since the last dweller was there, or maybe since the ship was built. It made him feel uneasy—the discomfort of sleeping in someone else's bed with their lingering presence. But even that didn’t matter.

It was still better than home. Better than the shouting, the slammed doors, the endless reminders of his shortcomings. The South Pole was the furthest he could get, and that was all he needed.

Getting onboard hadn’t been easy. They made him work and pay for it. Apart from learning the language, he had to endure training sessions on fire precautions: pine fires… sorry, Pinaceae fires, to be exact. According to the stories, it was the different kind of woods that interacted with the magic in the south. And wood from trees in the Pinaceae family was notorious for heating up near the pole until it self-combusted, bringing an end to many ships in the Blackout Zone. The training emphasized avoiding these dangers, drilling into them the importance of thorough inspections and containment measures. More paranoia than anything else, he thought, though he had to admit the warnings were grim.

On top of that, he had to buy access to endless training sessions about the language, procedures, and just basic information about Antarctica and the Blackout Zone. This included everything from survival tactics in extreme cold to understanding the limited medical facilities available on the mainland. Surprisingly difficult and expensive for something that was more an exile than an actual job.

‘You don’t want to know,’ one of the crew had said when Maarten asked about the previous occupant of B17. They hadn’t looked him in the eye when they said it. A few scraps of belongings—pictures, notes, useless clothes—were still scattered across the bunk. Nothing valuable, though. That had been picked clean long before Maarten arrived.

He started working the very next day. Naturally, as a newcomer, he was assigned to the night shift. But in his opinion, it didn’t matter that much. There were no shops or cafés open during the day to go to. Apart from being darker, not much separated the day from the night on the Groenvaart.

As an electrotechnician, he was assigned to a party of three. His supervisor, Hong Li, was a middle-aged Chinese man who hardly spoke but knew the ship like the back of his hand. Sienna Bloed was a short girl, about Maarten's age, in her early twenties. She was quite handy and seemed to have zero fear of climbing up to impossible places—something for which Maarten was quite grateful.

Maarten had just finished his electrotechnician MBO before applying for the job and had an ideal, almost naive, picture in his head about doing his job "properly." His job was the one place where he was not ignorant. This ship, though… it had been scraped together by generations of workers. If they channeled even a fraction of the paranoia about Pinaceae fires into electrical fire hazards, the Groenvaart wouldn’t have been allowed to move an inch from Rotterdam’s ports. For that reason, there was always something to do, and the days started to fly by very quickly.

After departing Rotterdam in mid-October, they sailed south following the coastlines of Europe and Africa. Their journey was planned to take about a month, with an expected arrival at Deception Island in late November or early December, weather permitting. There, they would unload their cargo, which mostly consisted of supplies for the people living on mainland Antarctica. As the training materials explained, the mainland could only receive supplies during the Australian summer in December and January, as this was the only time the waters near the mainland were traversable. Other than that, they were on their own.

For this very reason though, many ships were heading towards Deception Island at this time of the year. Everyone wanted to get there first to be able to sell the most supplies in the ports, but they couldn't have set out too early as information about the actual needs of the people only get to them well into the year. All in all this caused a busy season towards the South these days, which gave a bit of a comfort as ships often had helped each other when an accident had happened in the Blackout Zone.

Between shifts, it was the common areas where the ship really came to life. This was where the crew blew off some steam and let themselves enjoy their lives a little. They ate, drank, sang, gossiped, and swapped stories. Maarten got along well with most of the other crew. He knew that on a ship like this, everyone was running away from something, so they would put on a façade. He only had to interact with those façades, not the actual person.

He quickly picked up the slang and jokes as well. But that Merchant's Dialect kept tripping him up time and time again.

"No point worrying ‘bout the future, I say. Enough trouble in today’s problems," Zoltán muttered, his words slightly slurred.

"Very wise, ah? E ge yew tree make you crazy, Zoltán?" one of the crooks replied playfully.

Maarten blinked, frowning slightly. "What? Pines make you crazy now?"

The room erupted in laughter, and someone clapped him on the back like he’d just gasped for air.

"Yew tree, pup! Makes you wise—but sends you loco after!" the man said, mimicking someone losing his mind.

"Well, If they can’t brew beer, I’m not interested." Maarten replied.

A brief silence fell. Maarten hesitated, unsure if his joke would land. But when the room erupted in laughter once again, he couldn’t help but grin. For the first time since boarding, he felt like he belonged—if only for a moment.

As the days passed Maarten was more and more eager to reach the "Blackout Zone." This was where, about 2,500 km from the South Pole, the magnetic interference became so strong that no global telecommunication was possible. No radio, no GPS, no news from home about his family.

They left the African shoreline on Day 17 of their journey. From a job or everyday life’s perspective, it wasn’t that different. When they weren’t trying to fix some problem, their primary job was to replace the ship’s old incandescent lights with modern LED lights. For every light, they had to fight rusted screws, strip old wiring, trace faulty lines, install a new wire, connect it to a power supply, and finally secure the new light. Each step felt like a small battle against the ship itself, with sweat dripping from their brows and hands raw from gripping tools. Then they would move on to the next one. The repetitive nature of the work made the days blur together, a relentless rhythm that kept them grounded amidst the journey's monotony. 

He often overheard that radio communication was becoming harder and harder, until one day, when Maarten was working his night shift, he went to the deck and squinted at the horizon, confused. It was well past midnight, but the sky glowed with an eerie luminosity, casting a silvery-blue light over the waves. The Sun hung low, a pale orb that seemed drained of warmth, creating long, soft shadows that felt surreal. The air itself seemed heavy with a quiet stillness, as if the world had paused. The crew called it the Midnight Sun, a phenomenon that marked their arrival in the farthest reaches of the Earth.

And then there was the Aurora Australis. The Southern Lights were so bright they painted the pale blue sky with streaks of green and gold even during the Midnight Sun. The lights shimmered and danced, shifting in waves and ripples that seemed to breathe with life. It was a jaw-dropping sight, where even the most seasoned crewmembers stopped and gazed in wonder, unable to tear their eyes away. It reminded Maarten of the Northern Lights he had seen many times as a child, yet these felt different—deeper, more alive, with a mystic, almost otherworldly pulse, as though the place itself held its own heartbeat. "That’s the magic doing this," they said. "That’s why those bonkers live in them South Pole."

After that, no global radio communication was possible. Wherever they tuned their radio, they found only a strange, eerie static that was as unsettling as the world around them. Without GPS or functioning radios, the crew relied on ancient charts and celestial navigation. Every decision felt like a gamble, and even the most seasoned sailors seemed uneasy under the auroras’ glow.

To Maarten, it felt like the world had tilted sideways. The gravity of the situation slowly started to creep up on him, mixed with a sort of peace as it was now impossible to hear anything about his family.

Just a few days before their scheduled arrival at Deception Island, during an actual nighttime period, Maarten’s team was ordered to change lights in the main engine room. Of course, this was intentional, as the engine room’s ceiling was more than 13 meters high, and the crew needed someone to get up there willingly. Maarten gripped the railing as he watched Sienna scale the metal rungs bolted to the wall, ascending toward the ceiling with effortless grace. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” he said, shaking his head.

Just for the fun of it, Sienna let go with her feet, hanging only by her arms for a few seconds. She looked down at Maarten with a tease before proceeding with installing the new light.

“You’re insane,” Maarten said when she came down, his voice light, but there was admiration in his tone. She caught it and raised an eyebrow. “You’re just jealous.”

At that moment, the fire alarm went off.

At first, Maarten thought it was just another drill. But then he looked at Hong’s face and saw confusion and fear. Supervisors were always notified before drills, and conducting one in the Blackout Zone was unusual. Maarten quickly realized this was for real.

"Fire at cargo bay D! All personnel, proceed to the nearest gathering point!" blared the ship’s intercom.

“Quick! Zho! Zho! Go!’ shouted Hong as they rushed toward the deck. The ship’s engines rumbled beneath their feet, the vibration faint but constant, as Maarten, his team, and some other crew members scrambled toward the deck. The alarms were deafening, but there was no sign of the fire where they were.

Unease rippled through the crew as they climbed deck after deck in the engine room. Maarten’s team was at the end of the trail, so they reached the exit last. That was what saved their lives. At that moment, a gun fired with a deafening sound, and the people ahead of them dropped to the floor. They didn’t see the attacker. Shocked, they slammed the door shut and locked it from the inside.

“Oh my God! Did you see that? This doesn’t feel like an accident,” said Sienna.

“Yeah, it’s an attack,” answered Maarten.

Right then, the rumble of the engine started to die off. They were shutting down the main engine. Moments later, the lights flickered and shifted to battery-powered emergency lighting. They didn’t start the backup generators, which caused most of the machinery to stop. As the engine room descended into silence, the distant gunfire and explosions became obvious.

“We need to move,” said Sienna.

“But where?” asked Hong, confused.

“Hong, you know this ship better than the captain. There’s got to be another way out.” said Maarten.

“Well, there are some not-so-obvious routes. I can take us to the kitchen, for example.”

“There’s a lifeboat near the kitchen,” suggested Sienna.

“Wonderful. Take us there, Hong,” ordered Maarten, and they started their journey back down deep into the belly of the ship, then through narrow service routes. Eventually, they arrived at a shaft that descended from far above, with pipes and wires without number. On the side of the shaft was a ladder.

“We climb here,” said Hong.

They all climbed up the greasy ladder, their hands sticking to every peg along the way, the metallic smell of rust mingling with the oily residue that clung to their fingers. Finally, as Hong had promised, they arrived at the deck through the kitchen floor. The lifeboat was just outside the door. Maarten cautiously peeked outside and saw the lifeboat was guarded. The attackers clearly weren’t letting anyone escape—the bodies in the corridor told him as much.

The roar of the fire and the sound of explosions grew louder and louder, each boom reverberating in their chests. They were drenched in sweat, their hearts pounding like war drums, but the adrenaline coursing through their veins kept them moving. The acrid stench of smoke and burning metal filled the air, and every breath felt like inhaling needles. Even in places untouched by fire, the poisonous fumes were pervasive, stinging their eyes and throats. Hiding was not an option. If they wanted any chance of survival, they had to act. And they had to act fast.

Maarten still had his toolbelt on him. He hadn’t thought to take it off when they started escaping. He took out his nippers and cut the wire from a kitchen appliance.

“Listen,” he whispered, “someone needs to create a distraction. I can take him out when he turns away.”

“I can take care of that,” said Sienna, grabbing two frying pans before creeping toward the other door. A moment later, a loud crash sounded down the corridor.

“Hoi! Who’s there?” the attacker shouted, spinning towards the noise. That was Maarten’s cue. He sprang forward, looping the cable around the man’s neck and pulling with all his might. The rifle fired once in reflex, but the man dropped it as he clawed at the wire. He started to fight Maarten, slamming both of them into the corridor wall, but it was no use. The fight soon turned into a panic, then stillness. The attacker dropped to the deck, lifeless. Just then Maarten noticed his armband. A bright orange piece of textile bore a simple yet striking logo: a stylized tree shaped like a ‘Y,’ its base resting in a half-circle that resembled a pot. The stark black lines against the vivid orange background gave it an air of authority and mystery, as if it held a deeper meaning Maarten couldn’t yet grasp.

Maarten stepped over him, took his gun, and rolled him over to salvage his radio when he saw his face. Panic and struggle were frozen onto it, his eyes still open. It shocked Maarten, forever burning the picture into his mind. He was about to move when a voice barked through the corridor.

“Hoi, Donovan!” Another attacker stepped out from the corner, gun in hand. Maarten panicked and fired his gun. At that moment, he would have fired at anyone. The man immediately dropped to the floor, blood pooling beneath him.

That was too much for Maarten. “What have I done? This could have been Sienna!” he thought. His vision blurred, bile rose in his throat, and he lost sense of his surroundings. He’d boarded this damn ship to escape his dying mother and his once-loving father, now consumed by grief and anger. Oh, how much he had loved her. “You are a good person, Maarten. Your father doesn’t mean what he’s saying,” she had said. Now that good person had taken two lives within a minute. How much he craved his mother’s comfort now.

A blinding amber light flashed in front of his eyes, snapping him back to reality. Trying to rub the floaters out of his vision, he realized that Hong had pulled the lever on the lifeboat, and it inflated. But the damn thing had three mighty LED beacons for obvious reasons, and they started to flash when the boat inflated.

“This is going to get us killed,” Maarten said finally and jumped onto the boat to see if he could turn them off. But there were no switches, and everything was molded waterproof. He could see the wire, though. Without much thought, he took his nippers again and cut the wire. The short circuit caused an explosion with a large bang and a flash of light, breaking his nippers. But it was all dwarfed by the turmoil of the ship, and the lights immediately died out.

“How are we supposed to get found now?” Sienna asked.

“I haven’t thought that far. Let’s get the hell out of here first,” Maarten said. Just then, they heard on the radio:

“We found the crate. We got the package!” one voice said.

“Abandon ship! Abandon ship!” another voice called out.

Maarten and his comrades deployed the lifeboat and dropped onto the ocean. If it had been cold before, now it was freezing. Icy water sprayed into their faces stinging them like a million needles as the waves tossed them around. Fortunately, the same waves started to drift them away from the ship as they clung to the boat for dear life. Maarten wondered how long they would last in these conditions. Soaking wet and cold, tossed by the waves. Their hands became numb as they clung to the ropes on the boat. Maarten was not sure if he could ever open his hands to take it off the rope. This was when they saw how big the fire was. As the fire reflected on the water, it seemed like a scene from hell, consuming the whole world. There was no escape for the Groenvaart, its fiery demise consuming the ship entirely.

Luck was on their side, as the attackers’ ship was on the other side of the Vaart, so they hadn’t been seen. They were already at a safe distance when the attackers blew a hole in the side of the ship to finish it off. They heard the command and the cheers on the radio until the signal dropped out and once again, that eerie static took its place. The ocean also started to calm down, as if it were exhaling, relieved that the horrors of the night had passed.

They were alone. But alive. Maarten tried to fix the beacon, but quickly concluded that he didn't have the necessary tools, nor could he use his hand well enough to make it work. He wondered if this numbness would ever go away or he would lose his hands. In case of course if they lived. But they discovered that their salvaged radio had a distress call function, so they turned it on. But with this much interference, a rescue ship would need to get within a few kilometers of them to even pick up the signal.

As the sun started to rise on the horizon, their luck turned once more. They spotted a ship approaching in the distance. Needle in a haystack is an understatement for how improbable that was, but the Silver Frost had come right their way and picked up the distress call. In the morning sun they saw the orange lifeboat and took the three survivors in and made their way towards Deception Island.

They had plenty of time to ponder about the attack. It was clear from the radio that the attackers had been looking for something on the ship and they managed to get it, but what? And what group it is with the logo of a tree in the pot? The crew of the Silver Frost knew nothing about it either.

The attackers also wanted to leave no survivors and there they were. The attackers probably had inside help as well, someone causing a fire, distracting the crew. Maarten couldn’t shake the unease of knowing he might one day encounter someone who should be dead, someone who had been part of the attack.

And on top of all that, he was a murderer now. The face of the first man he killed never left his mind. It lingered in his thoughts like a shadow, an unerasable mark that no amount of time could heal. For the first time in his life, thinking about this made him question who he truly was.

They arrived at Deception Island three days after their rescue. "Well, that's not how I imagined first arriving at this place," Maarten said, his voice laced with exhaustion and relief, as they gently sailed through Neptune's Bellows and into the calm waters of Port Foster. It felt like a haven, a small respite amidst the chaos they had endured and the chaos that was to come.
